### What is this page? 
Hello 👋🏾 - Welcome to my GitHub Repository, displaying my MSc Thesis based on creating a functional Convolutional Neural Network that can classify between different cases of Frontotemporal Dementia, based on T1-weighted MRI data! 

### Where was the data derived from?! 
The data was provided by the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative (FTLDNI), a study funded by the by the National Institute on Aging (Primary) and the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke - this data is competely open and free and there are no concerns regarding ethics.
